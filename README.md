# ü©∏ PlasmaX ‚Äì Plasma Donation Management System

PlasmaX is a mobile application designed to streamline the management of plasma donations. The app facilitates two main sections:

1. **Donor Section** - Managed by hospitals, where plasma donors can register and their details are stored for future reference.
2. **Receiver Section** - Allows plasma receivers to search for available donors based on location, whether from a hospital or an individual.

## üöÄ Features

### **Donor Section** (Hospital Management)

* **Plasma Donation Registration:**

  * Hospitals can register donors, entering their details such as name, blood group, donation date, and other medical details.
  * Donors are stored in the system with expiry information, as plasma has a shelf life of 90 days from the donation date.
* **Plasma Expiry Calculation:**

  * Automatically tracks and calculates the expiry date of the plasma, ensuring only valid donations are considered.

### **Receiver Section** (Plasma Requester)

* **Search for Donors:**

  * Plasma receivers can search for available donors based on their **location**.
  * The receiver can select if they want plasma from a **hospital** or **individual donor**.
* **Hospital Plasma Availability:**

  * If the receiver opts for a hospital donation, they are shown a list of plasma available in nearby hospitals.
* **Individual Donor Plasma Availability:**

  * If the receiver chooses an individual donor, the app will display a list of individuals who have donated plasma within the last 90 days and are available in the nearby area.
  * Individual donors are only shown if they have donated their plasma in a hospital.
